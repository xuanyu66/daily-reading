## 摘录
- > familiarity is not the same as taking it seriously.
- > Taking compounding seriously means taking it a step further. Your net worth is just one implication. What else compounds? Your life experiences and knowledge. What would it mean to leverage compounding here? If you’re taking compounding seriously, you’d learn the skills with the greatest return first. That means learning the broadest applicable skills you’d apply throughout your life first. That means learning how to think well - before learning the new fancy tech you want to learn.
- > A good way to practice this is to ask this question: What are the implications of (idea) in (field of interest)?


familiarity即熟悉，taking ideas seriously 大意就是精通并躬身行之。

复利是大家都熟悉的概念，一般用于货款以及计算收益，但是不仅仅'金钱' 有复利的概念。你的知识以及人生经历都受复利影响，学会将复利从原始领域应用到其它领域，并躬身行之，可以说是 'taking ideas seriously'

个人对于复利有一个小思考是：正因为复利的存在，你现在的一些行动需要在更久的未来产生效力，同理，你现在的现状来源于你的过去所从事事情产生的复利，所以在面对困境时，着眼于更远的未来，把握手头一点点的复利，以其未来能够反转人生。

## [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail)

- 这篇文章写的很好，可以单独拿出来让大家来读。
- 首先正视细节（可怕的，让人惊讶的，想象不到的），细节的存在是整个宇宙的基本规律，不要将被细节困住视作个人的失败 (We run into a fundamental property of the universe and mistake it for a personal failing.)
- 怎么陷入细节的困境
  - >  seek detail you would not normally notice about the world. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built. When you talk to someone who is smart but just seems so wrong, figure out what details seem important to them and why. In your work, notice how that meeting actually wouldn’t have accomplished much if Sarah hadn’t pointed out that one thing. As you learn, notice which details actually change how you think.
  - 总结
    - 更多的关注细节，比如你忽略掉的花的细节；
    - 向别人学习
      - 看起来那么聪明的人，却做一件看起来是错误的事情
      - 一些模糊的讨论是如何讨论到要点的
